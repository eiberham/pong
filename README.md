# Squash game

This is a game development practice and the first time i use phaser to build something, the project involves the setup of webpack, es2018 transpilation and some ESLint rules.


As described somewhere on the internet:

> Squash is a racket sport (and technically a ball sport) played by two (singles) or four players (doubles squash) in a four-walled > court with a small, hollow rubber ball. The players alternate in striking the ball with their racquets onto the playable surfaces > of the four walls of the court.

For the purpose of this game, there's only a single player and one have to hit the ball as much as possible in order to score points.
